# AI-Based PC Access Agent
Description:

Developed an AI-powered PC Access Agent designed to intelligently manage and monitor access to a system based on user behavior and authentication protocols. The agent leverages computer vision and rule-based logic to ensure secure and automated login/logout experiences for enhanced productivity and security.

Key Features:

🔐 AI-Based Face Recognition using OpenCV and deep learning models (e.g., FaceNet or Dlib) to authenticate users in real-time.

👀 Live Activity Monitoring to detect user presence and auto-lock the PC when the user steps away.

🕹️ Gesture or Voice Commands Integration for contactless access or system control (optional feature).

📈 Behavior Logging System to track login times, session durations, and suspicious activity for auditing.

💼 Custom Rules Engine to define policies like idle timeout, restricted hours, or dual-factor verification.

📊 Dashboard Integration (optional) to visualize system usage and user activity trends.

Technologies Used:

Python, OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Tkinter or Electron (for UI), SQLite or MongoDB (for logs)

Optional: Voice Recognition APIs, PyAutoGUI, Flask (for web interface)

Use Cases:

Personal and enterprise-level PC security

Smart workspace automation

AI-powered parental control systems
